Since the 1970s, IBM mainframe technology has been extremely important in various sectors of the economy.

In recent years, we have seen various initiatives to replace mainframe servers, but with few exceptions, these initiatives have had little or no success.

In large mainframe installations, for example in the financial sector, the millions of lines of code written in COBOL make a technology refresh project unfeasible in the medium term due to the high costs and risks involved.

What has changed to make this possible?

The open source revolution. By mixing different open technologies, it is possible to replicate mainframe functionality on a low-cost infrastructure.
