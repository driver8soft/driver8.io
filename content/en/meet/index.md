#### Dear user:

Please be aware that driver8 is currently a sandbox project under development. It can be used to carry out proofs of concept (pilots) in a secure environment to validate its correct functioning before going into production.

If you wish to test the capabilities of driver8 on your production software by running a pilot test, please contact us.
 

#### Dear Developer:

We recognise that it is not typical for individuals to own an IBM mainframe on which they can conduct tests.

If your company or organisation is interested in collaborating on the development of the project, we would be pleased to hear from you.
